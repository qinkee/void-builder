# Roo-Code Integration Summary

## Overview

Roo-Code is now integrated into void-builder as a built-in extension that gets packaged during the build process. The integration fetches Roo-Code from a private repository and includes it in the final void installation package.

## Key Changes

### 1. Build Scripts

- **`get_roo_code.sh`**: Fetches Roo-Code from private repository to `./roo-code` directory
- **`build_roo_code.sh`**: 
  - Installs dependencies using pnpm
  - Builds the extension (compiles TypeScript to JavaScript)
  - Copies compiled files from `./roo-code` to `.build/extensions/roo-code`
  - Verifies critical files exist (dist/extension.js, webview-ui, etc.)
- **`build.sh`**: Modified to call Roo-Code build before extension compilation

### 2. GitHub Actions Workflows

All workflows (Linux, macOS, Windows) have been updated with:
- `INCLUDE_ROO_CODE=yes` environment variable
- Get Roo-Code step before build that uses GitHub secrets

### 3. Required GitHub Configuration

#### Secrets (Required)
- `ROO_CODE_TOKEN`: Personal Access Token with read access to private repo
- `ROO_CODE_REPO`: Private repository URL (e.g., `https://github.com/YourOrg/roo-code-private`)

#### Variables (Optional)
- `ROO_CODE_VERSION`: Version/tag to use (default: `v3.25.11`)

## How It Works

1. GitHub Actions runs `get_roo_code.sh` to clone private repository
2. During build, `build_roo_code.sh` copies source files to extensions directory
3. Standard void build process packages all extensions including Roo-Code
4. Final installation includes Roo-Code as built-in extension

## Local Development

```bash
# Set up authentication
export ROO_CODE_TOKEN="your-github-pat"
export ROO_CODE_REPO="https://github.com/YourOrg/roo-code-private"
export INCLUDE_ROO_CODE=yes

# Fetch and build
./get_roo_code.sh
./build.sh
```

## Benefits

- No modifications needed in void core project
- Clean separation of concerns
- Easy to enable/disable Roo-Code inclusion
- Secure handling of private repository access
- Works across all platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows)
